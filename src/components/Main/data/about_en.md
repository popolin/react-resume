#### Intro
I'm currently coding at [BairesDev](https://www.bairesdev.com) where I work as a software engineer. My main activities are: coding solutions in NodeJS and ReactJS. I use SOLID principles, TypeScript, ESLint and several other tools that help with code quality and teamwork. I really enjoy suggesting alternatives and refactoring code.

I'm also interested in working with Next, React Native, Prisma and others. I like to be up to date about new technologies.

#### Some history

- In 90's I have earned my first computer. At that time was necessary to ran games on MS-DOS.

- In 1994 I have my first contact with internet. Companies in BR start building their first websites. Took minutes to open an simple image.

- I subscribed my first Internet provider in 1995 I guess. It was AOL and I remember that dialing song trying to establish connection. I still remember installing it from a floppy disk.

- Later 1995 I had my first course: MS-DOS, Word, Excel and Power Point. My teacher name was Abi.

- In 1996 a frine of mine, Rogério, helped me to get into the [IRC](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) and I start spending hours talking to people online. I use to wake up very early because it was expensive to keep the internet conected for a long.

- At 19, I took a course to learn Web Design. That included Photoshop, DreamWeaver and some other tools. It was at [Studio Online](https://www.studioonline.com.br) and my teacher was Fred.

- At 20, I started my graduation at [Unip](http://unip.br) where I have my first contact to algorithms, programming logic and basic languages. I coursed Science Computing.

- In the same year I started the graduation, 2001, I had some other courses to define what was going to be my area to work. What I would like to do. I studied [MER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–relationship_model) and [Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)) at [Senac](https://www.senac.br).

- In 2001 I also created my first website. It just contained a lot of static informations about the September 11.

- Few months later I started working as a traineer in two companies at the same time: in the morning I was a Database Reports Generator at [Vivo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCO) and after lunch I was a Call Center Attendant at [Banco do Brasil](https://www.bbts.com.br).

- During that time I was working daily and studying at night. I decided to start a Java Course during the weekends. That was at [Blue Star](http://bluestar.technology) and opened some doors to my professional life.

- At the begining of 2002 I start working as Java Programmer at [Unimed](https://www.unimed.coop.br) where I had my first experience with a real project. I was programming by myself and that was a Swing App to exchange POP/SMTP informations between Unimeds and hospitals.

- At 22 I won an event called Marathon Java at the Catholic University of Brasilia.

- At 31 I opened my company focused on Startups.

- At 32 I my Startup was selected to be through an aceleration in Silicon Valley [TechMission](https://revistapegn.globo.com/Startups/noticia/2013/08/conheca-startups-vencedoras-da-techmission-2013.html) and that opened my mind to learn new things.

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
