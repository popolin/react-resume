#### Currently
I'm a Senior Software Engineer at ClearCo, passionate about building technology that makes a difference. I specialize in Node.js, Vue.js, React.js, React Native, and NestJS, and I strongly believe in Object-Oriented Programming, SOLID principles, clean code, and design patterns to create maintainable and scalable solutions.
Over my career, I’ve built impactful systems in healthcare, fintech, and education. Now based in Florida, I’m open to consulting on meaningful projects and available for remote collaboration.

#### Some history

- I got my very first computer in the 90s. Back then, running a game meant dealing with MS-DOS — it was tricky, but magical.

- I connected to the internet for the first time in 1994. Websites were just starting in Brazil, and opening a single image could take several minutes.

- Around 1995, I subscribed to my first internet provider: AOL. I can still hear that unforgettable dial-up tone trying to connect. I even installed it from a floppy disk.

- Later that year, I took my very first computer course: MS-DOS, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. My teacher’s name was Abi, and I still remember the excitement of learning those tools.

- A friend of mine, Rogério, introduced me to [IRC](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) in 1996. I spent hours chatting with people online and even woke up super early to connect — since internet time was expensive back then.

- At 19, I took a Web Design course at [Studio Online](https://www.studioonline.com.br), learning Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and other tools. My teacher, Fred, was a big inspiration.

- At 20, I began my Computer Science degree at [UNIP](http://unip.br), where I first learned about algorithms, programming logic, and coding basics.

- In 2001, alongside my degree, I studied [MER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity–relationship_model) and [Delphi](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software>) at [Senac](https://www.senac.br) to explore different career paths. That same year, I built my first website — a simple static page full of information about September 11. 

- A few months later, I landed my first roles: mornings as a Database Reports Trainee at [Vivo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCO), and afternoons as a Call Center Attendant at [Banco do Brasil](https://www.bbts.com.br). At the same time, I was studying at night and taking a Java course at [Blue Star](http://bluestar.technology) on weekends.

- In early 2002, I became a Java Programmer at [Unimed](https://www.unimed.coop.br), where I developed a Swing application to exchange POP/SMTP information between hospitals and other branches — my first real project, done solo.

- At 22, I won the Java Marathon at the Catholic University of Brasília — a proud milestone early in my career 🏆.

- At 31, I launched my own company focused on startups, diving into the entrepreneurial world.

- In 2013, at 32, my startup was selected for [TechMission](https://revistapegn.globo.com/Startups/noticia/2013/08/conheca-startups-vencedoras-da-techmission-2013.html), an acceleration program in Silicon Valley. That experience completely broadened my perspective and shaped the way I approach innovation.

- In 2015, I joined Trix TI to build apps for clinics and laboratories, working on impactful solutions for healthcare. During this time, I also had the chance to travel across Brazil.

- In 2021, two incredible things happened in my life:

1. Personal: My daughter was born — the biggest love of my life and my greatest source of inspiration. ❤️

2. Professional: I started working for U.S.-based companies such as Digital Trends, Clipboard Health, and PayPal, marking another major milestone and opening the door to global projects.

- In 2023, I joined ClearCo, a Canadian-based company, which has challenged and inspired me every day.

- In 2024, I had the chance to meet my team in person during an on-site in Toronto, Canada. Dude, that was awesome — I felt lucky and grateful to be part of such an amazing team.

And of course, there are many more stories — but some are best told in person. 😉
