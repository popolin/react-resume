#### Some history

- I got my very first computer in the 90s. Back then, running a game meant dealing with MS-DOS ‚Äî it was tricky, but magical.

- I connected to the internet for the first time in 1994. Websites were just starting in Brazil, and opening a single image could take several minutes.

- Around 1995, I subscribed to my first internet provider: AOL. I can still hear that unforgettable dial-up tone trying to connect. I even installed it from a floppy disk.

- Later that year, I took my very first computer course: MS-DOS, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. My teacher‚Äôs name was Abi, and I still remember the excitement of learning those tools.

- A friend of mine, Rog√©rio, introduced me to [IRC](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) in 1996. I spent hours chatting with people online and even woke up super early to connect ‚Äî since internet time was expensive back then.

- At 19, I took a Web Design course at [Studio Online](https://www.studioonline.com.br), learning Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and other tools. My teacher, Fred, was a big inspiration.

- At 20, I began my Computer Science degree at [UNIP](http://unip.br), where I first learned about algorithms, programming logic, and coding basics.

- In 2001, alongside my degree, I studied [MER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity‚Äìrelationship_model) and [Delphi](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software>) at [Senac](https://www.senac.br) to explore different career paths. That same year, I built my first website ‚Äî a simple static page full of information about September 11. 

- A few months later, I landed my first roles: mornings as a Database Reports Trainee at [Vivo](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/TCO), and afternoons as a Call Center Attendant at [Banco do Brasil](https://www.bbts.com.br). At the same time, I was studying at night and taking a Java course at [Blue Star](http://bluestar.technology) on weekends.

- In early 2002, I became a Java Programmer at [Unimed](https://www.unimed.coop.br), where I developed a Swing application to exchange POP/SMTP information between hospitals and other branches ‚Äî my first real project, done solo.

- At 22, I won the Java Marathon at the Catholic University of Bras√≠lia ‚Äî a proud milestone early in my career üèÜ.

- At 31, I launched my own company focused on startups, diving into the entrepreneurial world.

- In 2013, at 32, my startup was selected for [TechMission](https://revistapegn.globo.com/Startups/noticia/2013/08/conheca-startups-vencedoras-da-techmission-2013.html), an acceleration program in Silicon Valley. That experience completely broadened my perspective and shaped the way I approach innovation.

- In 2015, I joined Trix TI to build apps for clinics and laboratories, working on impactful solutions for healthcare. During this time, I also had the chance to travel across Brazil.

- In 2021, two incredible things happened in my life:
  - Personal: My daughter was born - the biggest love of my life and my greatest source of inspiration. ‚ù§Ô∏è
  - Professional: I started working for U.S.-based companies such as Digital Trends, Clipboard Health, and PayPal, marking another major milestone and opening the door to global projects.

- Almost three years later, I joined ClearCo, a Canadian-based company, which has challenged and inspired me every day.

- The following year brought an unforgettable experience: I had the chance to met my team in person during an on-site in Toronto, Canada. Dude, that was awesome!

- In 2025, a lifelong dream came true: my family and I moved to the U.S., starting a new chapter filled with opportunities, growth, and exciting challenges.

And of course, there are many more stories ‚Äî but some are best told in person. üòâ
